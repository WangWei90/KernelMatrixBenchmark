## Introduction

It seems each time you turn around there is a new programming language aimed at solving some specific problem set. Increased proliferation of programming languages and data are deeply connected in a fundamental way and increasing demand for “data science” computing is a related phenomenon. In the field of scientific computing Chapel, D, and Julia  are highly relevant programming languages, they arise from different needs and are aimed at different problem sets. Chapel focuses on data parallelism on single multicore machines and large clusters, D was initially developed as a more productive safer alternative to C++ and Julia was developed for technical and scientific computing and aimed at getting the best of both worlds from static programming languages which have high performance and safety with the flexibility of dynamic programming languages, however they all emphasize performance as a feature. In this article, we look at how their performance varies over kernel matrix calculations and present approaches to performance optimization and other usability features of the languages.

Kernel matrix calculations are the basis of kernel methods in machine learning applications. They scale rather poorly `O(m n^2)`, `n` is the number of items and `m` is the number of elements in each item. In our exercsie `m` will be constant and we will be looking at execution time in each implementation as `n` increases. Here `m = 784`, and `n = 1k, 5k, 10k, 20k, 30k`, each calculation is run 3 times and an average is taken. We disallow any use of BLAS and only allow use of packages or modules from the standard library of each language - though in the case of D the benchmark is compared with calculations using Mir, a multidimensional array package to make sure that my implementation of matrix reflects the true performance of D. The details for the calculation of the kernel matrix and kernel functions are given [here](https://github.com/dataPulverizer/KernelMatrixBenchmark/blob/master/docs/kernel.pdf).

Two benchmark types are given, one in IEEE mode - the default mode and another in fast math which violates IEEE floating point calculation standards, breaks the laws of associativity due to rounding errors, and breaks `NaN` and `Inf`. For this price faster timings on calculations can be achieved.

While preparing the code for this article, the Chapel, D, and Julia communities were very helpful and patient with all enquiries, so they are acknowledged here.

In terms of bias, going in I was much more familiar with D and Julia than I was of Chapel, however getting the best performance from each language requried a lot of interaction with each programming community and I have done my best to be aware of my biases and attempt to correct for them. If the reader has any issue with the way this analysis has been conducted, they can raise it with the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dataPulverizer/KernelMatrixBenchmark) where the code to carry out the calculation is located.

## Language Benchmarks for Kernel Matrix Calculation

The [above chart](https://github.com/dataPulverizer/KernelMatrixBenchmark/blob/master/charts/charts.r) shows the performance benchmark time taken in seconds (log scale) against the number of items (`n` as above) for nine kernels all executed on Chapel, D, and Julia for IEEE mathematics calculations. The chart below shows a repeated benchmark as above when using the fast math calculations in each language.
<img src="https://github.com/dataPulverizer/KernelMatrixBenchmark/blob/master/charts/fmbenchplot.svg" width="800">

In the IEEE mathematics case, Julia performs better than D and Chapel in all kernels, and in cases where fast math is used, the performance of Julia falls behind Chapel and D in all but the power benchmark. Both Chapel and D show very similar performance in all the performance benchmarks.

It is worth noting that the effect of using fast math violates IEEE standards, it breaks NaNs and infinity, and also violates associativity law due to rounding off errors. In most real world applications IEEE standard rather than fast math would be used. In addition the mathematics functions used in D were pulled from C's math module made available in the D compiler in its `core.stdc.math` module. This was done because the mathematical functions in D's standard library [`std.math`](https://dlang.org/phobos/std_math.html) can be slow. The math functions used are given [here](https://github.com/dataPulverizer/KernelMatrixBenchmark/blob/master/d/math.d). By way of comparison consider the [mathdemo.d](https://github.com/dataPulverizer/KernelMatrixBenchmark/blob/master/d/mathdemo.d) script comparing the imported C `log` function D's log function from `std.math`:

```bash
$ ldc2 -O --boundscheck=off  --mcpu=native mathdemo.d && ./mathdemo
Time taken for c log: 0.58623 seconds.
Time taken for d log: 2.3747 seconds.
```
#### Suitability of Matrix object used
The Matrix object used in the D benchmark was implemented specifically because use of modules outside language standard libraries was disallowed for this article, but to make sure that this implementation is competitive i.e. does not unfairly represent D's performance, it is compared to Mir's ndslice library written in D. The chart below shows the difference in execution times of the kernel matrix calculation between my implementation of a matrix and ndslice as a percentage of my matrix's kernel benchmark running time. Negative means that ndslice is slower and positive times mean that ndslice is faster. Across the timing are about the same and ndslice is broadly speaking slightly faster (apart from the Dot product benchmark), in the case of `log` and `power` kernel, ndslice's times are *much faster*, the difference is just over 40% across all data sizes, however this large difference however is due to the functions used rather than the implementation of the Matrix object, so the Matrix object used is a fair representation of D's performance.

## Environment

The code was run on a computer with an Ubuntu 20.04 OS, 32 GB memory and an Intel® Core™ i9-8950HK CPU @ 2.90GHz with 6 cores and 12 threads.

```bash
$ julia --version
julia version 1.4.1
```

```bash
$ dmd --version
DMD64 D Compiler v2.090.1
```

```bash
ldc2 --version
LDC - the LLVM D compiler (1.18.0):
  based on DMD v2.088.1 and LLVM 9.0.0
```

```bash
$ chpl --version
chpl version 1.22.0
```

### Compilation

Compilation is done with scripts see the `script.sh` file in each language folder and the the `script.sh` script in the [home folder](https://github.com/dataPulverizer/KernelMatrixBenchmark) of the repository.

## Implementations 

Efforts were made to avoid non-standard libraries while implementing these kernel functions. The reasons for this are:

* It's completely transparent and shows how each language works.
* Packages outside standard libraries can go extinct so avoiding external libraries keeps the article and code relevant.
* Making it easy for a reader after installing the language to copy and run the code. Having to install external libraries can be a bit of a "faff".

### Chapel

Chapel uses a `forall` loop to parallelize over threads. Also C pointers to each item is used rather than the default array notation and `guided` iteration over indices are used:

```chpl
//Chapel
proc calculateKernelMatrix(K, data: [?D] ?T)
{
  var n = D.dim(0).last;
  var p = D.dim(1).last;
  var E: domain(2) = {D.dim(0), D.dim(0)};
  var mat: [E] T;
  var rowPointers: [1..n] c_ptr(T) =
    forall i in 1..n do c_ptrTo(data[i, 1]);

  forall j in guided(1..n by -1) {
    for i in j..n {
      mat[i, j] = K.kernel(rowPointers[i], rowPointers[j], p);
      mat[j, i] = mat[i, j];
    }
  }
  return mat;
}
```

Chapel code was the most difficult to optimise for performance and required the most in terms of code changes.

### D

D uses a `taskPool` of threads from its `std.parallel` package to parallelize code. The D code underwent the least amount of change for performance optimization, a lot of the performance benefits came from the specific compiler used and flags selected (discussed later). My implementation of a `Matrix` allows columns to be selected by reference `refColumnSelect`.

```d
auto calculateKernelMatrix(alias K, T)(K!(T) kernel, Matrix!(T) data)
{
  long n = data.ncol;
  auto mat = Matrix!(T)(n, n);

  foreach(j; taskPool.parallel(iota(n)))
  {
    auto arrj = data.refColumnSelect(j).array;
    foreach(long i; j..n)
    {
      mat[i, j] = kernel(data.refColumnSelect(i).array, arrj);
      mat[j, i] = mat[i, j];
    }
  }
  return mat;
}
```

### Julia

The Julia code uses `@threads` macro for parallelising the code and `@views` macro for referencing arrays. One confusing thing about Julia's arrays is their reference status. Sometimes as in this case arrays will behave like value objects and they have to be referenced by using the `@views` macro otherwise they generate copies, at other times they behave like reference objects, for example passing them into a function. It can be a little tricky dealing with this because it's not always obvious which set of operations will generate a copy, but where this occurs `@views` provides a good solution.

The `Symmetric` type saves the small bit of extra work needed for allocating to both sides of the matrix.

```jl
#Julia
function calculateKernelMatrix(Kernel::K, data::Array{T}) where {K <: AbstractKernel,T <: AbstractFloat}
  n = size(data)[2]
  mat = zeros(T, n, n)
  @threads for j in 1:n
      @views for i in j:n
          mat[i,j] = kernel(Kernel, data[:, i], data[:, j])
      end
  end
  return Symmetric(mat, :L)
end
```

The `@bounds` and `@simd` macros in the kernel functions were used to turn bounds checking off and apply SIMD optimization to the calculations:

```jl
struct DotProduct <: AbstractKernel end
@inline function kernel(K::DotProduct, x::AbstractArray{T, N}, y::AbstractArray{T, N}) where {T,N}
  ret = zero(T)
  m = length(x)
  @inbounds @simd for k in 1:m
      ret += x[k] * y[k]
  end
  return ret
end
```

These optimizations are quite visible but very easy to apply.

## Memory Usage

The total time for each benchmark and memory used was captured using the `/usr/bin/time -v` command. The output for each of the languages is given below:

The complete calculation in Chapel took about the same amount of time as D to execute but consumed less memory (nearly 9GB RAM peak memory):
```
	Command being timed: "./script --verbose=true --fastmath=false"

```

D consumed the most amount of memory (around 20GB RAM peak memory) and took about the same total time as Chapel to execute:

```
	Command being timed: "./script"
	User time (seconds): 112787.04
	System time (seconds): 47.36
	Percent of CPU this job got: 1187%
	Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 2:38:20
	Average shared text size (kbytes): 0

	Average stack size (kbytes): 0
	Average total size (kbytes): 0
	Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 20849980
	Average resident set size (kbytes): 0
	Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 0
	Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 18100437

	File system outputs: 8
	Socket messages sent: 0
	Socket messages received: 0
	Signals delivered: 0
	Page size (bytes): 4096
	Exit status: 0
```

Julia consumed the least of memory (around 7.5 GB peak memory) and ran the quickest - mainly because the functions used in it's log and power kernels were more efficient those used in D and Chapel:

```
	Command being timed: "julia script.jl data true"
	User time (seconds): 49163.19
	System time (seconds): 32.08
	Percent of CPU this job got: 717%

	Exit status: 0
```

## Performance optimization

The process of performance optimization in all three languages was very different and all three communities were very helpful in the process. But there were some common themes.

* Static dispatching of kernel functions instead of using polymorphism. This means that when passing the kernel function, use parametric (static compile time) polymorphism rather than runtime (dynamic) polymorphism were dispatch with virtual functions carries a performance penalty.
* Using views/references rather than copying data over multiple threads – makes a big difference.
* Parallelising the calculations makes a huge difference.
* Knowing if your array is row/column major and using that in your calculation makes a huge difference.
* Bounds checks and compiler optimizations makes a huge difference especially in Chapel and D.
* Enabling SIMD in D and Julia made a contribution to the performance. In D this was done using the `-mcpu=native` flag and in Julia this was done using the `@simd` macro.

In terms of language specific issues, getting to performant code in Chapel was the most challenging and the Chapel code changed the most from easy to read array operations to using pointers and guided iterations. But on the compiler side it was relatively easy to add `--fast` and get a large performance boost.

In D the code changed very little and most of the performance was gained in the compiler used and optimization flags. D’s LDC compiler is rich in terms of options for performance optimization. It has 8 `-O` optimization levels but some are repetitions of others for instance `-O`, `-O3`, and `-O5` are identical, and there are a myriad of other flags that affect performance in various ways. In this case the flags used were `-O5 --boundscheck=off –ffast-math` representing aggressive compiler optimizations, bounds checking, and LLVM’s fast-math and `-mcpu=native` to enable CPU vectorization instructions.

In the Julia the macro changes discussed previously markedly improved the performance but they were not too intrusive.

## Quality of life

This section examines the relative pros and cons around the convenience and ease of use of each language. People underestimate the effort it takes to use a language day to day, the support and infrastructure required is a lot so it is worth comparing various facets of each language. Readers seeking to avoid the TLDR should scroll to the end of this section for the table comparing the language features discussed here. Every effort has been made to be as objective as possible but comparing programming languages is difficult, bias prone, and contentious so read this section with that in mind. Some elements looked at such as arrays are from the “data science”/technical/scientific computing point of view and others are more general.

### Interactivity

Programmers want a fast code/compile/result loop during development to quickly observe results and outputs in order to make progress or necessary changes; Julia’s interpreter is hands down the best for this and offers a smooth and feature-rich development experience, and D comes a close second. This code/compile/result loop in compilers can be slow even when compiling small code volumes. D has three compilers, the standard DMD compiler, the LLVM-based LDC compiler, and the GCC-based GDC. In this development process, the DMD and LDC compilers were used. DMD has **very** fast compilation times which is great for development. The LDC compiler is great at creating **fast** code. Chapel's compiler is very slow in comparison, to give an example running Linux’s `time` command on DMD vs Chapel’s compiler for the kernel matrix code with no optimizations gives us for D:

```
real	0m0.545s
user	0m0.447s
sys	0m0.101s
```
Compared with Chapel:

```
real	0m5.980s
user	0m5.787s
sys	0m0.206s
```
That’s a large actual and *psychological* difference, it can make programmers reluctant to check their work and delay the development loop if they have to wait for outputs especially when source code increases in volume and compilation times become significant.

It is worth mentioning however that when developing packages in Julia compilation times can be very long, and users have noticed that when they load some packages compilation times can stretch so the experience of the development loop in Julia could vary, but in this specific case the process was seamless.

### Documentation and examples

One way of comparing documentation in the different languages is to compare them all with Python’s official documentation which is *the* gold standard for programming languages, it combines examples with formal definitions and tutorials in a seamless and user friendly way. Since many programmers are familiar with the Python documentation this approach gives an idea of how they compare.

Julia’s documentation the is closest to Python’s documentation quality and gives the user a very smooth detailed and relatively painless transition into the language, it also has a rich ecosystem of blogs and topics on many aspects of the language are easy to come by. D’s official documentation is not as good and can be challenging and frustrating, however there is a *very* good free book [“Programming in D”](https://wiki.dlang.org/Books) which is a great introduction to the language but no single book can cover a programming language and there are not many sources for advanced topics. Chapel’s documentation is quite good for getting things done though examples vary in presence and quality, often the programmer needs a lot of knowledge to look in the right place. A good topic for comparison is file i/o libraries in Chapel, D, and Julia. Chapel’s i/o library has too few examples but is relatively clear and straightforward, D’s i/o is kind of spread across a few modules and documentation is more difficult to follow, Julia’s i/o documentation has lots of examples and is clear and easy to follow.

Perhaps one factor affecting Chapel’s adoption is lack of examples, since its arrays have a non-standard interface the user has to work hard to become familiar with them, were as even though D’s documentation may not be as good in places, the language has many similarities to C/C++ and so gets away with more sparse documentation.

### Multi-dimensional Array support

“Arrays” here do not refer to native C/C++ style arrays available in D but mathematical arrays. Julia and Chapel ship with array support and D does not but it has the [Mir](http://docs.algorithm.dlang.io/latest/mir_ndslice.html) which has multidimensional arrays (ndslice). In the implementation of kernel matrix, I wrote my own matrix object in D – which is not difficult if you understand the principle but it's not something a user wants to do, however D has a linear algebra library called [Lubeck](https://github.com/kaleidicassociates/lubeck) which has impressive performance characteristics and interfaces with all the usual BLAS implementations. Julia’s arrays are by far the easiest and most familiar, Chapel arrays are more difficult to get started than Julia’s but are designed to be run on single core, multicore and computer clusters using the same or very similar code which is a good unique selling point.

### Language power

Since Julia is a dynamic programming language some might say, “well Julia’s is a dynamic language which is far more permissive than static programming languages therefore the debate is over” but it’s more complicated than that. There is power in static type systems, Julia has a type system similar in nature to type systems from static languages so you can write code as if you were using a static language but you can do things reserved only for dynamic languages, it has a highly developed generic and meta-programming syntax and powerful macros. It also has highly flexible object system and multiple dispatch. This mix of features is what makes Julia is the most powerful language of the three.

D was intended to be a replacement for C++ and takes very much after C++ (and also borrows from Java) but makes template programming and compile time evaluation much more user friendly than in C++, it is a single dispatch language (though multi-methods are available in a package), instead of macros D has string and template “mixins” which serve a similar purpose.

Chapel has generic programming support and nascent support for single dispatch OOP, no macro support, and is not yet as mature as D or Julia in these terms.

### Concurrency & Parallel Programming

Nowadays new languages tout support for concurrency and it’s popular subset parallelism but the detail varies a lot between languages. Parallelism is more relevant in this example and all three languages deliver. Writing parallel for loops required is straightforward in all three languages.

Chapel’s concurrency model has much more emphasis on data parallelism but has tools for task parallelism and ships with support for cluster-based concurrency.

Julia has good support for both concurrency and parallelism.

D has industry strength support for parallelism and concurrency, though its support for threading is much less well documented with examples.

### Standard Library

How good is the standard library of all three languages in general? What range of tasks do they allow users to easily tend to? It’s a tough question because library quality and documentation factor in. All three languages have very good standard libraries, D has the most comprehensive standard library, but Julia is great second then Chapel, but things are never that simple. For example, a user seeking to writing binary i/o may find Julia the easiest to start with, it has the most straightforward clear interface and documentation, followed by Chapel and then D, and Julia code is easy to write for cases unavailable in the other two languages.

### Package Managers & Package Ecosystems

In terms of documentation, usage and features, D’s Dub package manager is the most comprehensive. D also has a rich package ecosystem in the [Dub website](https://code.dlang.org/), Julia’s package manager runs tightly integrated with GitHub and is a good package system with good documentation. Chapel has a package manager but does not have a highly developed package ecosystem.

### C Integration

C interop is easy in all three languages; Chapel’s has good documentation but is not as well popularised as the others. D’s documentation is better and Julia’s documentation is the most comprehensive. Oddly enough though, none of the language documentations show the commands required to compile your own C code and integrate it with the language which is an oversight especially when it comes to novices. It is however easy to search for and find examples for the compilation process in D and Julia.

### Community

All three languages have convenient places where users can ask questions. For Chapel, the easiest place is Gitter, for Julia it’s Discourse (though there is a Julia Gitter) and for D it’s the official website forum. The Julia community is the most active, followed by D and then Chapel. I’ve found that you’ll get good responses from all three communities but you’ll probably get quicker answers from D and Julia communities.

Table for quality of life features in Chapel, D & Julia

## Summary

If you are a novice programmer writing numerical algorithms and doing calculations based in scientific computing and want a fast language that's easy to use Julia is your best bet. If you are an experienced programmer working in the same space Julia is still a great option. If you specifically want a more conventional "industrial strength" static compiled high performance language with all the "bells and whistles" but want something more productive, safer and less painful than C++ then D is your best bet. You can write "anything" in D and get great performance from its compilers. If you need to run array calculations on large clusters while avoiding the pain of writing MPI C++ code then Chapel is probably best place to go.

In terms of raw performance on this task Julia is the winner clearly performing better in all 9 kernels benchmarked for using IEEE math, however for applications that use fast math D and Chapel largely provide better performance. This exercise reveals that Julia's label as a high performance language is more than just hype, it has held it's own against highly competitve languages. Chapel and D's performance were very similar to each other in both the IEEE and fast math modes of calculation
